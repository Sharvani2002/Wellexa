# Wellexa

### Description:
A health/food monitoring application. Many times things like nutritional information or something like that are ignored. These can indirectly cause other issues and build up chronically. We hope to solve this problem and help people stay fit!It also reminds you to take medicines and do Yoga!



### Tech stack used:
Python, Deep Neural Networks, HTML, CSS, Django,Flask,Javascript

### Libraries and dependencies required for the project (If any) 
Posenet, Tensorflow, pyttsx3, schedule, random, time, getpass

### Installation steps: 
1.pyttsx3:

      This project is written in Python 3.8.3 using Pyttsx3 (text-to-speech conversion library in Python. 
      Unlike alternative libraries,  it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
      
         pip install pyttsx3 

2.schedule

      Python job scheduling for humans. Run Python functions (or any other callable) periodically using a friendly syntax.
      
         pip install schedule
         
3.random

      This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
      
         import random
         
4.time

      This module provides various time-related functions.
       
          import time
          
5.getpass

     getpass() prompts the user for a password without echoing. The getpass module provides a secure way to handle the password prompts where programs interact with the users        via the terminal
     
6.Tensorflow

      TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of       deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.
      
           pip install Tensorflow
           
7. Posenet

       PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.
